My spell book! Yes! I open it with tab, and flip pages with Q and E!
Oh no! A lot of the spells are missing and I don't remember how to craft them!
How do I craft a new spell... Oh yeah! I press 3 of the number keys, then the button of the spell slot I want to assign it to!
If I'm in the middle of crafting, I can cast a spell to cancel it!
I'll probably find more of my spells hidden around. On to escaping!
