# Washed-Up-Wizard

Welcome to Washed Up Wizard, a 3d top-down shooter where you play as a crazy wizard with all kinds of magical abilities at your disposal to take down enemies. You have your spell book and many spell components that you combine in different ways to make spells with different effects.

Game was released years ago, I just recently got it working in the current version of Unity, so here is all the source code! Feel free to use anything from this project in your games!
